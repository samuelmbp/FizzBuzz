# TDD FIZZBUZZ PROJECT

## WHAT IS FIZZBUZZ?

### FizzBuzz Is a simple coding challenge. The objective of FizzBuzz is to create a program with the following specification: 
 
  1. The program can be passed a number.
  
  2. When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
  
  3. When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
  
  4. When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'FizzBuzz'.
  
  5. In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.
